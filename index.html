            <h1>How to Keep Yourself Safe ?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="main-content">
            <p>
                It is unfortunate that I must make an article about this but I feel it is really needed. We women are
                not safe anywhere, be it our home or workplace, places of worship or places like a bar/pub. Predators
                are always lurking in the shadows around us, waiting for the right time to pounce. It is in our hands to
                keep ourselves safe and here are some ways we can do it.
            </p>
            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Fitness</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    Make sure you are in good physical health. Keep your cardiovascular strength in good shape (so that
                    you can run) Eat healthy foods. If you are going out alone, carry comfortable footwear with you that
                    you can change into during your commute. Learn self defence like how to get out from certain types
                    of holds, etc. and keep practicing them to make sure you know how to use the skill during times of
                    emergency.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Self Defence Gadgets</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    1. The most known gadget is <b>pepper spray</b> and it is very effective when its used properly.
                    Look up
                    videos on how to use it and practice with a spray water bottle. You’ve to aim for the eyes.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                    2. The next best option is <b>Pain Relief spray</b>. They come in travel sizes and are easily
                    available
                    everywhere, unlike pepper sprays. Again, AIM FOR THE EYE. You can also use a hairspray and a lighter
                    and make a flamethrower. Melt the fuckers’ face off and RUN.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                    3. <b>Pocket Knife</b>- Keep a pocket knife/mini cutter with you while going out. As the name
                    suggests,
                    keep it in the pocket. Not in your purse, not in your backpack. Practice how to open in quickly and
                    make sure the knife does not get stuck. Predators will not give you time to open it. Again, while
                    travelling, knives are not allowed in certain countries. Your best option is metal cutlery like
                    forks.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                    4. <b>Pen/ Nail filer</b>- You can use these simple everyday objects to injure someone and get
                    enough time
                    to run. Again, aim for the sensitive areas.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                    5. <b>Portable Door Locks</b>- They add additional security to your door if you are staying at a
                    hotel.
                    Carry them and use them correctly for added security. Before locking the doors, make sure to check
                    the room and window locks.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                    6. <b>Portable Emergency Alarms</b>- There are portable keychain type alarms available that are made
                    for
                    self-defence. When used, they make a loud siren sound that can be used to scare off attackers. If
                    heard for a long time, they can cause hearing loss so use with care.
                </p>

                <p class="section-content">
                    7. <b>High Powered Flashlights</b> can be used to temporarily blind the attackers giving you enough
                    time to
                    RUN or call for help.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Emergency Preparation</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    Keep your emergency contacts updated. Every phone has a SOS option. Open it right now and update it.
                    Learn and remember what buttons will send out SOS alerts to the police and to your loved ones. Keep
                    it always activated. Put in your medical details in your phone like your blood group, allergies and
                    relevant medical condition.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                    Location Tracking Apps can be used to keep your friends and family about your location. I use
                    <b>Life360</b>. It shows me where each of my family members are at all points of time. Switch on
                    your phone
                    location while going out and keep at least 2 people informed of your whereabouts.
                </p>

                    When you need a fire brigade or an ambulance, you thus call the emergency number <b>112 (or

                    you call the emergency number 112 in India for the police, you are redirected to the emergency
                    number 100. Because of this, valuable time is saved for dialing multiple numbers.
